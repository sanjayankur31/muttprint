	* fix removal of tempdir()'d print-files
	Problem Description
	1. muttprint never printed back-to-back on my printer,
	and always gave an error at line 819 of the script
	(function printDuplexCups()).
	2. On checking this function, the logic tells that the
	child prints odd pages, while the parent prints even
	pages. This .ps email is put under /tmp/muttprint-XXXXXX
	directory, which was removed by tempdir(), even before
	the parent gets the chance to print the even pages. Hence
	the error.
	
	This behavior can be tuned by the the SPEED variable,
	which is set to 30 (seconds) by default. This is highly
	unpredictable, as networks can get very slow at times -
	this is what I experienced here. Tweaking the code,
	I found out that there is no need to fork at all
	(unless there is a good reason for the parent-child
	processes printing the odd-even pages). This also does
	not ensure the printing would happen on the same page -
	we could not print back-to-back.
	
	To fix this, the fork() and the sleep() [in parent] have been removed
	from printDuplexCups(). This has been tested at my end, and works
	perfectly fine. Similar thing can be done in the other function
	printDuplexNoCups(), but I haven't tested it.

	* added CREDITS
	* applied patch by Fernando to implement REM_SIG handling:
	Configuration setting of REM_SIG now enables or
	disables printing of a signature and subsequent
	attachements.  This means:
	If REM_SIG is on and SIG_REGEXP is found, the
	printing of the remainder of the email is skipped.
