0.72e      - 2005-08-14:1521 - Fernando Pereda, Lukas Ruf
             - added CREDITS
             - applied patch by Fernando to implement REM_SIG handling:
               Configuration setting of REM_SIG now enables or
               disables printing of a signature and subsequent
               attachements.  This means:
               If REM_SIG is on and SIG_REGEXP is found, the
               printing of the remainder of the email is skipped.
             - never released publicy
          
0.72d      - 2005-03-04:2011 - Lukas Ruf <lukas.ruf@lpr.ch>
             New Maintainer
          
0.72c      - Added "looking for a new maintainer" info
          
0.72b      - fixed some errors (utf-8)
          
0.72a      - added Portuguese translation
          
0.72       - added Finnish translation
           - changed internationalization completely, read the manual for
             more information, it is all documented
             · requires Perl 5.8 or Linux or external C program 
               "muttprint-langinfo"
             · requires Text::Iconv or (but this is NOT required) external
               iconv
             · conviguration by the locale environment
           - removed LANG and CHARSET configuration option and command
             line switches
           - output error messages using 'dialog' if installed
           - running in foreground by default, new variable BACKGROUND
           - changed translation "API" to English names (changed all
             distributed translations so there sould be no problem)
           - improved layout
          
0.71       - changed shebang line to #!/usr/bin/env perl because it works
             on all system regardless where perl is installed (only in
             release, not in CVS)
           - new configuration option SIG_REGEXP which specifies the
             regular expression used to recognize the signature
           - translated `Organization:' header
           - added Gentoo pictures
           - added `docdirname' variable in Makefiles which specifies the
             name of the directory created in `docdir'. The naming scheme
             is a bit confusing but I didn't want to break compatibility.
           - no translation adaptions because changes are small and I
             wanted to release it quickly because of Gentoo
          
0.70       - changed fontpackage for Times to `mathptm' and the package
             for Palatino to `mathpazo' because `times' and `palatino' are
             obsolte (according to de.comp.text.tex)
           - added font options `AvantGarde', `CentSchool', `Chancery' and
             `Helvetica'
           - code cleanup
           - complete rewrite of printing code
           - supporting the CUPS printing system (set PRINT_COMMAND to `CUPS'),
             i.e. when using this setting the `psnup' and `psselect' programs
             are not needed and when setting DUPLEX to `printer' CUPS is
             responsible for duplex printing
           - removed detection of geometry.sty version by making `compat2' to
             a global option [closes Debian-Bug #180615]
           - added UTF-8 support (experimental)
           - reversed this CHANGES file (first entry is most current version)
           - added KOI8-R support (experimental); this works not on all LaTeX
             systems, so use teTeX 2.0 if you have problems
           - added Russian translation, thanks to Alex Semenyaka
           - changed translation directory to /usr/share/muttprint/translations
             according to FHS
           - creating temporary dir using File::Temp module which honors the
             TMPDIR environment
           - removed *png and *jpg from the distribution because it's not needed
             by Muttprint -- you find this files still in the CVS if you need it
           - removed temporary *sed files from distribution (by changing Makefiles)
          
0.64       - add compatibility option for new geometry.sty

           - limited size of subject in the headline to 60 chars
          
0.63a      - replaced absolute paths in the documentation with variables;
             the variables are replaced before building the documentation
           - applied some Debian patches:
             . replaced cwd() from Cwd with getcwd() from POSIX
             . replaced sgmltools -j ... option with the -s option

0.62a      - updated Italian and French translation
          
0.62       - printing Euro sign works ($charset must be set to "latin9")
           - more ASCII charaters are escaped -> printing the header
             should work now with *all* ASCII chars
           - new options: $FONTSIZE and $WRAPMARGIN
           - full support of Windows-1252 and Windows-1250 charsets
             as superset of latin1 and latin2
           - simple automatic detection of charset if $charset=auto
             (use this carefully!) 
             [Normally you should set $charset in dependence of
             the Mutt $charset variable]
           - new options: $DATE, $DATE_FORMAT
           - new option: $ADDRESSFORMAT (specifies the format of the
             adresses in the mailheader
           - new option: $RCFILE (additional configuration file)

           - fixed bug with reading configuration files
          
0.60       - translation strings are now in external files
             (in the $prefix/lib/muttprint directory)
           - NEWSGROUP_STRING in ~/.muttprintrc changed to
             NEWSGROUPS_STRING because the RFC header is named

           - improved the code for recognizing the Realname in the
             header up to page 2
           - the external program "fmt" is not needed any more -- its
             functionality has been integrated in Muttprint
             (this should solve problems on plattforms other than
             Linux which uses not GNU fmt)
           - moved documentation format from Latex to DocBook
             (this has no effects for the end user beside of
             the other layout of the documentation)
           - Implemented decoding of Quoted Printable in headers and in 
             the body. This makes it possible to print raw messages
             (without attachments).

           - support for /etc/papersize (thanks to Chanop Silpa-Anan)
           - add README.Gnus to the archive in reality (it was missing
             before because of an missing symlink)
          
0.52a      - turned off displaying configuration options to STDOUT

0.51       - deleted German comments in THIS file because it's useless
           - add support for real PostScript duplex printers 
             (thanks to Chanop Silpa-Anan for the help)
