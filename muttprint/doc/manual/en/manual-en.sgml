	<title>About Muttprint</title>

	<para>The printing of mails from Mutt (and lots of other mail clients) is
		done as ``plain text''. Normally, that's enough, but in my opinion it's
		not so beautiful like a formatted printing, e.&nbsp;g. from 
		<application>Netscape</application>.</para>

	<para>Another fact disturbed me: The printing contains all displayed header
		informations. I've configured Mutt that it displays things like
		<quote>X-Mailer</quote>, but I don't want to print this. 
		<application>XFMail</application> is quite worse: It prints all header
		information, so the printing is in my opinion unusable.</para>

	<para>Sometime I had the idea to write a script myself, which creates a
		nice printing. And here's the result. I think it looks quite better als
		plain ASCII text and is comparable with the printing of well-known
		mail clients under Microsoft Windows.</para>

		<para>Make sure that a LaTeX distribution (I recommend teTeX higher
			than version 1.0) plus the programs <emphasis>psselect</emphasis> 
			and <emphasis>psnup</emphasis> from the <emphasis>PS-Utils</emphasis>

			<title>Installation of the packages</title>
			
			<para>If your distribution uses a package management system such as
				RPM or DPKG, it is a good idea to use the correlatively
				packages. The greatest advantage is the simple uninstallation.</para>

			<para>Most Linux distributions use the RPM package management
				system. The easiest way to install the package is the command</para>

			<para>
				<prompt>#  </prompt>
				<userinput>rpm -Uvh 
muttprint-<replaceable>Version</replaceable>-<replaceable>Release</replaceable>.noarch.rpm
				</userinput>
			</para>
			
			<para>All RPM packages are signed with my GnuPG-Key (ID DDAF6454).
				You get more detailled information about RPM and verification of
				signatures in  <ULink url="http://www.rpm.org/maximum-rpm.ps.gz">Maximum
				RPM</ULink>.</para>

			<para>The Debian packages are created by Chanop Silpa-Anan 
				<email>chanop@debian.org</email> and are normally available
				a few days after a new release of Muttprint. The could be

		<title>Integration of Muttprint in mail and news clients</title>

		<para>Muttprint was orginally developed for the use together with Mutt only.
			However, it could be integrated in following mail programs without problems. 
			I got some description of users. Muttprint would be work 
			independently of Mutt in future, too.</para>
		
		
		<sect3 id="muttconfig">
			<title>Mutt</title>
		
			<para>You have to add or change following line in the file
				<Filename>$HOME/.muttrc</Filename> or system wide in
				<FileName>/etc/Muttrc</FileName>:</para>

			<ProgramListing>set print_command="muttprint"</ProgramListing>

			<para>Moreover you must make sure that all necessary headers
				are dumped when the mail is printed out. The easiest way
				is to write a small macro (in your <filename>~/.muttrc</filename>)
				which makes sure that all headers are dumped. Only the
				most important headers are really printed (see 
				<xref linkend="printedheaders">).</para>

			<para>Here's the macro:</para>

			<programlisting>
# Dump all headers
macro index p "&lt;display-toggle-weed&gt; &lt;print-message&gt; &lt;display-toggle-weed&gt;"
macro pager p "&lt;display-toggle-weed&gt; &lt;print-message&gt; &lt;display-toggle-weed&gt;"
			</programlisting>

			<para>At first, the macro switches to the mode where all headers are
				shown, then the mail is printed and finally it switches back. It
				is necessary to turn the confirmation of printing off so that
				the macro works right:</para>

			<programlisting>
# No confirmation before printing
set print="yes"
			</programlisting>

			<para>To print more than one mail sensible in one step, you
				should add following entry:</para>

			<ProgramListing>
# Print every mail extra
set print_split
			</ProgramListing>

			<para>You'll find more information in the documentation of Mutt
				(<Filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/mutt/manual.txt</Filename>).</para>

		</sect3>

		<sect3>
				<title>Slrn</title>

				<para>Simply add following lines in your configuration file 
					<filename>~/.slrnrc</filename>:</para>

	      <programlisting>
% Use Muttprint for printing
set printer_name "muttprint"
	      </programlisting>

				<para>If Muttprint should print more headers than this which are
					displayed on the screen, you have to use instead of the
					normal printing command <keycap>y</keycap> the combination
					<keycap>Esc</keycap>, <keycap>1</keycap>, <keycap>y</keycap>
					(one after another). This is important for printing the
					X-Face header, see <xref linkend="xface">.</para>

		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>XFMail</title>

			<para>In the dialogue <GUImenu>Misc</GUImenu>, <GUImenuItem>Config
				Misc</GUImenuItem> you have to do an entry in <GUIlabel>Print
				Command</GUIlabel>:
				<literal>/usr/bin/muttprint -f $f</literal>.</para>

			
			<Note>				
				<para>With some versions of <Application>XFMail</Application>,
					problems are reported because XFMail does not add the
					headers in the printing. This is not a problem of Muttprint.
					To solve the problem you could look for a new version
					of XFMail which doesn't have this bug.</para>
					
				<para>See also the <ulink
					url="http://slappy.org/listarchives/xfmail/2001-June/002398.html">
					XFMail developer mailing list archive</ulink> for a solution.</para>

			<title>Gnus</title>


			<para>Muttprint could be integrated in
				<application>Gnus</application>, too. I got a Lisp code from a
				user that realizes the integration. Please ask me no questions
				about this because I don't know Lisp and don't use
				<application>(X)Emacs</application> myself.</para>
				
			<para>You find the code in <filename>README.Gnus</filename> and I
				would like to refer to this file in this manual. If you use
				packages for the installation you should find this file in the
				<filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/muttprint/</filename>
				directory.</para>

			<title>Other mail clients</title>
			
			<para>Muttprint works with all mail programs theroretically if they
				comply with following conditions:</para>
				
			<ItemizedList spacing="compact">
				<listitem>	
					<Para>The output must be plain ASCII text without any
					  formattings.</Para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<Para>You must be able to choose the printing command freely.</Para>
				</listitem>
			</ItemizedList>
	
			<para>Newsreader are also supported because the
				<ComputerOutput>To</ComputerOutput> header is optional
				and the
				<ComputerOutput>Newsgroups</ComputerOutput> header is also
				evaluated.</para>
			
			<para>If you use Muttprint with other programs than mentioned above, please
				send me a short message in which you describe how you've configured
				the program. I could add the description here.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="config">
	<title>Configuration</title>
		
	<sect2>
		<title>The configuration file</title>
		
		<para>Some things could be configured in Muttprint. This is permanently
			done in  the configuration files <filename>$HOME/.muttprintrc</filename>
			(only for the current user) or <filename>/etc/Muttprintrc</filename>
			(global for all users). User settings override global settings.</para>
			
		<para>The configuration file is structured in a way that values are
			assigned to different variables -- this is different from
			<filename>.muttrc</filename>. The name of the variable stands
			first and is case sensitive; take over them exactly. Then follows a
			equal sign (<literal>=</literal>) without any whitespace.
			At last, there's the value. Quotes (<literal>'</literal> or
			<literal>"</literal>) are optional.</para>
		
		<para>An example for a configuration file is distributed with
			Muttprint  (<filename>sample-muttprintrc</filename>). If you've
			installed a RPM  or debian package, you'll find it in
			<filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/muttprint/</filename>.</para>
			
		<para>An example for a correct assignment:</para>
		
		<ProgramListing>VARIABLE=value</ProgramListing>
		
		<para>Normally the script works without any adapts. But it is
			recommended to inform about the possibilities you have.</para>

		
		<sect3>
			<title>Printer</title>
			
			<para>If Muttprint should not print to <emphasis>lp</emphasis>, you can change 
				this by setting <literal>PRINTER</literal> to the correct value.</para>
				
			<para>To print in a file, you could use following syntax, the name
				(and location) of the file is freely chosable:</para>

			<ProgramListing>PRINTER="TO_FILE:/foo/bar/test.ps"</ProgramListing>
			
			<para>If duplex printing is enabled, Muttprint creates a second file
				with the prefix <filename>2</filename>, e.&nbsp;g.
				<filename>test.ps2</filename>.</para>
				
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Penguin</title>
			
			<para>As a default setting it is printed a little penguin on the right
				top of the page. If there should be another picture or if the
				penguin has another location as Muttprint assumes, you can
				configure this by setting the <literal>PENGUIN</literal> variable
				to the right value. The picture must be in Encapsulated
				PostScript (you could use <command>convert</command> from
				the <application>Image Magick</application> package for
				converting your favourite picture into EPS) and it is
				scaled to a height of 2&nbsp;cm (5.08 in). The logo
				must not have a higher width than height.</para>
				
			<para>If <literal>PENGUIN=on</literal>, Muttprint tries to
				find out the location of the penguin file. (Read the source
				code to find out, where Muttprint searches.) This is the
				default setting.</para>
				
			<para>Additionally, Muttprint comes with some example pictures that 
				are already converted into the EPS format. After the installation,
				you'll find this in <filename>/usr/share/muttprint</filename>.</para>
				
			<para>If the printing of the graphic should turned off,
				set <literal>PENGUIN</literal> to the value <literal>off</literal>.
				</para>
			
		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="xface">
			<title>Printing of X-Faces</title>

			<para>X-Faces are black and white pictures with a size of 48 x 48 pixels,
				that could be included as mailheader (the <literal>X-Face:</literal>
				header) in each message. This is no <quote>official</quote> standard
				but it is spread especially in news articles.</para>

			<para>Muttprint supports the printing of this picture instead of the
				image specified with the <literal>PENGUIN</literal> varaible. To do
				this, set <literal>XFACE</literal> to <literal>on</literal>. If there's
				no such header, the <literal>PENGUIN</literal> picture (or nothing)
				is printed.</para>

			<para>To work right, following two programs are required:</para>
			
			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<application>convert</application> from the
						<ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org"><application>Image

					</para>
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>

		<para>Both programs should be part of common Linux distributions and
			can simply be installed.</para>
		
		<para>In any case you must make sure that this header is really dumped
			to Muttprint. If you use Mutt, see <xref linkend="muttconfig"> for a
			correct configuration. Otherwise read the documentation of your mail
			software.</para>


		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Duplex printing</title>
			
			<para>Muttprint allows manual duplex printing. It prints odd pages
				at first, waits a while and prints then even pages.</para>
				
			<para>Muttprint needs the speed of your printer to calculate
				the time when the printing of even pages will start,
				see <xref linkend="speed">.</para>
				
			<para>To activate the duplex printing, set <literal>DUPLEX</literal>
				to <literal>on</literal>.</para>
				
			<para>If you own a real Postscript printer and if this printer
				has duplex capabilities, you should set <literal>DUPLEX</literal>
				to <literal>printer</literal>. This changes the Postscript
				code in a way that tells your printer to enable automatic duplex
				printing.</para>				
		</sect3>
		
		<sect3>
			<title>Paper save mode</title>
			
			<para>It's possible to print two pages on one page in landscape.
				This allows you to save paper and ink and increases the printing
				speed. This makes only with the paper format DIN A4 sense because
				two reduced pages fit exactly to one sheet.</para>
			
			<para>To enable this mode, set <literal>PAPERSAVE</literal> to
				<literal>on</literal>.</para>				
		</sect3>
		
		<sect3 id="speed">
			<title>Printing speed</title>
			
			<para>As mentioned above, Muttprint requires the duration which your
				printer needs to print one page. This setting is done by setting
				the variable <literal>SPEED</literal> to the value in seconds
				(only integers are allowed). Default is 30&nbsp;seconds 
				(<literal>SPEED=30</literal>).</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Font</title>
			
			<para>You could use different fonts for the printing. The
				correspondent variable is names <literal>FONT</literal>.
				<literal>Latex</literal> (standard steting) means the standard LaTeX font
				of the EC family. <literal>Latex-bright</literal>
				uses <emphasis>Computer Modern Bright</emphasis>. This font is not
				available on current Debian systems because of its license<footnote>
				<!-- Footnote -->
					<para>You can download this font and install it on your computer from
						the CTAN. You find the fonts in
						CTAN:/tex-archive/nonfree/fonts/cmbright/ (CTAN =
						<emphasis>Comprehensive TeX Archive Network</emphasis> consists of a
						network of several servers. The CTAN server in Germany is
						<ulink url="ftp://ftp.dante.de"></ulink>, in the United Kingdom
						<ulink url="ftp://cam.ctan.org"></ulink> and in the United States
						<ulink url="ftp://tug.ctan.org"></ulink>).

			<para>There are several Postscript fonts which are possible here: 
				<literal>Times</literal>, <literal>Palatino</literal>,
				<literal>Utopia</literal>, <literal>Charter</literal> and
				<literal>Bookman</literal>.</para>

			<para>Of course the fonts has to be installed on your system. As the LaTeX 
				distribution <emphasis>teTeX</emphasis> is standard on Linux systems,
				this should be no problem.</para>

		<sect3>
			<title>Rules under/over head- and footline</title>
			
			<para>There could be printed a rule under the headline
				resp. over the footline. They are turned off
				as default.</para>

		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Paper format</title>
			
			<para>To set the paper format, set <literal>PAPER</literal> to the right
				value. Possible are only <literal>A4</literal> and
				<literal>letter</literal>.</para>
				
			<para>If there exists a file <filename>/etc/papersize</filename> as

		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Cut signature</title>
			
			<para>Often the signature contains unseless information or
				advertising and should therefore not be printed. Muttprint is
				able to cut the signature, if it was separated from the mail by
				using <quote><literal>&ndash;&ndash; </literal></quote> -- take
				a look at the whitespace (some mail clients don't generate a
				correct separator).</para>
				
			<para>To do this you've to set <literal>REM_SIG</literal> (this means
				<quote>remove signature</quote> to the value 
				<literal>on</literal>.</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Omit quoting</title>
			
			<para>Often the author of the mail does not quote sensibly but
				attaches the whole mail so that the printing becomes very long
				and confusing.</para>

			<para>If <literal>REM_QUOTE</literal> is set to
				<literal>on</literal>, the quoting will not be printed.
				Muttprint detects the quoting by using the same regular
				expression that Mutt does in its standard configuration. So the
				text which is color emphasized from Mutt should omited in the
				printing. This corresponds to the <emphasis>toggle
				quote</emphasis> funktion 
				(<keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>t</keycap></keycombo>)
				on screen.</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="printedheaders">
			<title>Printed headers</title>
			
			<para>Normally only the interesting headers are printed. You
				could change this settings with the variable 
				<literal>PRINTED_HEADERS</literal>. Specify each header
				separated with a underline (<literal>_</literal>).</para>
		
			<para>The order is important for the printing. The evaluation
				is case-insensitive. Headers that doesn't exist are ignored.
				For bold printing embed the name of the header in
				stars (<literal>*</literal>), for italic printing do the
				same with slashes (<literal>/</literal>).</para>

			<para>The default setting is:</para>
			
			<programlisting>PRINTED_HEADERS="Date_To_From_CC_Newsgroups_*Subject*"</programlisting>
			
			<para>One more example for a sensible setting:</para>
			
			<programlisting>PRINTED_HEADERS="/Date/_To_From_*Subject*_X-Mailer"</programlisting>

		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Error messages</title>
			
			<para>The output of <command>latex</command> and
				<command>dvips</command> are not displayed. If there are any
				problems, it would be helpful to read this output. Therefore
				you should set <literal>DEBUG</literal> to <literal>1</literal>
				in your  <filename>.muttprintrc</filename>. Now Muttprint
				creates a logfile named <filename>/tmp/muttprint.log</filename>
				in the next run so that you can watch the error messages. This
				could be helpful for all bug reports, too.</para>
		</sect3>
	</sect2>
	<sect2>
		<title>Command line options</title>
		
		<para>Most configuration settings could be made by command line options as well.
			The advantage is a easier integration in the mail client (e.&nbsp;g. with
			own macros).</para>
			
		<para>You find a detailled description of all options with
			<command>muttprint</command> <option>-h</option> 
			oder or in the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>muttprint</refentrytitle>
			<manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> manpage.</para>
			
		<para>The effects of this options are the same as in the configuration file
			but command line settings override all other settings.</para>


	</sect2>
	<sect2>
		<title>Different languages</title>
		
		<para>Muttprint supports the languages <emphasis>German</emphasis>, 
			<emphasis>Italian</emphasis>, <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis>, 
			<emphasis>French</emphasis> and <emphasis>English</emphasis>. 
			Normally the environment variable <envar>LANG</envar> is set to the
			right value: <literal>de</literal>, <literal>it</literal>,
			<literal>fr</literal>, <literal>es</literal> or
			<literal>en</literal>. Only the first two characters are recognized
			so that <literal>de_DE@euro</literal> is okay. If the value is not
			known, Muttprint falls back to English.</para>

		<para>If you would like to use another language for Muttprint than for
			the remaining system, you could define <literal>LANG</literal> in
			your <filename>.muttprintrc</filename>.</para>


		<sect3>
			<title>Lanuages on the printing</title>
		
			<para>The most important effects of language adaption are
				on the printing: the mail header and the date.</para>
				
			<para>The last one is created with the LaTeX package
				<filename>babel.sty</filename>. Muttprint passes the right
				option which corresponds to your language to the package. You
				could set your own value with the variable
				<literal>LPack</literal>, e.&nbsp;g. to <literal>austrian</literal>,
				<literal>spanish</literal>. Read <command>texdoc babel</command>
				for a list of all possible values.</para>

			<para>If you would like to use another strings for the printed

			<title>Charsets</title>
			
			<para>Different languages require different charsets. The default charset
			 of Muttprint is <emphasis>ISO-8859-1</emphasis> (same as ISO Latin 1).
			 Therewith the languages Afrikaans, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch,
			 English, Faeroese, Finnish,  French, Galician, German, Icelandic, Irish,
			 Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish and Swedish are
			 covered. Additionally, Muttprint replaces the characters 128 to 159 of
			 the charset <emphasis>cp1252</emphasis> (Microsoft Windows) with
			 sensible ASCII characters.</para>
			 
			<para>Support for <emphasis>ISO-8859-15</emphasis> (also ISO Latin 9)
				is not possible because it is missing in the LaTeX packages that are
				needed. That's why the Euro currency sign (character 164) is replaced by
				the string <literal>EUR</literal>.</para>

			<para>For Czech support the character set <emphasis>ISO-8859-2</emphasis>
			(ISO Latin 2) has become necessary. This is set automatically in a Czech
			environment. Otherwise you could set the variable
			<literal>charset</literal> to <literal>latin1</literal> or
			<literal>latin2</literal>.</para>
			
			<para>ISO Latin 2 supports the languages Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian,  
			 Czech, English, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Irish, Polish, Romanian,
			 Slovak, Slovenian and Sorbian. (Because the German umlauts are on the
			 same place in Latin 1 and 2, you could use both for printing German
			 mails.) Moreover the Cyrillic-based languages Macedonian and
       Serbian have one-to-one transliterations to Latin 2.</para>
			 
			<para>It is not possible to print characters from both charsets in
				one mail. To do this, Unicode is needed -- but there's no Unicode
				support for LaTeX as far as I know.</para>

		<sect3>
			<title>Translation file</title>
		
			<para>The Muttprint translation files are located in the
				<filename>share</filename> directory and have the name
				<filename>translation-<replaceable>language</replaceable>.pl</filename>.
				You could add new files in this directory without any changes
				on the Muttprint script. Not only the headers mentioned above
				but also the help message are translated here.</para>
			
			<para>For new translations take any file as template, copy it
				and translate it. If you would like to provide your translation
				to other users, just send me the new file with a e-mail
				and I'll add it in the next release.</para>

		<title>Printing of attachments</title>
		
		<para>Muttprint is not able to print mail attachments. To reach this,
			Muttprint would have to parse the raw MIME message and decode it.
			This is quite difficult. For example Muttprint would have to decrypt
			PGP-encrypted messages, choose the right alternative in 
			<literal>multipart/alternative</literal> messages and work recursive
			for <literal>message/*</literal> -- this are only a few things.
			Short: Essential parts of a mail client must be integrated and lots of
			settings (like for PGP) must be done. Moreover, not all mail clients
			support outputting the raw message for printing.</para>
			
		<para>But Mutt has itself a comfortable function to print attachments. You
			can choose a separate printing command for each MIME type. This could be
			set in <filename>~/.mailcap</filename>. Read further information
			in the Mutt manual, section 5.3.3.1.</para>

		<para>I've written a very small script named <literal>imageprint</literal>
			for printing images (almost every format is supported). You could use it
			as template for own scripts. Here it is:</para>			

		<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
target=/tmp/imageprint-$$.ps
convert -page A4 $1 $target
lpr $target
rm $target</programlisting>
		
		<para>Just press the <keycap>p</keycap>-key in the attachment menu of
			Mutt.</para>
		
		<para>Users of other mail clients should read the documentation for
			information about how to print attachments.</para>

		<title>Thanks</title>
		
		<para>to all who helped me with their bug reports to improve and
			enhance Muttprint. Especially I want to thank Roman Beigelbeck for
			providing additional pictures, Roberto Vallone for the Italian
			transation, Vincent Bernat for the French translation, Marcelo
			Ramos for the Spanish tranlation, Dominik Form&aacute;nek for
			the Czech translation and the Debian maintainers Dr.
			Guenter Bechly and Chanop Silpa-Anan.</para>

		<para>Finally I would like to thank all people who contributed
			to free software. Most people did this in their spare time
			without receiving a penny for this!</para>
