	* UTF-8 encoding fixups:

	"I was having some trouble getting Muttprint to work on
	my system, which uses UTF-8 throughout. Apparently,
	LaTeX refers to UTF-8 as "utf8x" instead of "utf8"
	which is used in the code (specifically, on line 970
	in the main program file). I'm attaching a patch for
	this against the 0.72d release; you may want to, if not
	include this in the mainstream code, at least mention
	it in the readme or installation instructions to save
	others the frustration."
