1. Installation
   ------------
   
   To install Muttprint on your system, adjust the locations in the
   Makefile. 

   The default settings should be OK. (Installation to /usr/local)

   Then run "make install" to install the files on your system. Please
   recognize that you must run this as 'root' if you would like to
   install Muttprint global on your system.

   If you don't want to change the Makefile, you should run "make
   prefix=/new/path install" as done by creation of RPM packages. Set
   /new/path to your prefered directory.


2. Uninstallation
   --------------

   To uninstall, run "make uninstall" or "make prefix=/new/path
   uninstall" if you had specified any prefix in the installation.

   For further information about Muttprint, read the documentation. It
   is available in PDF and HTML (and in Docbook-SGML-Sources if you are
   developer.)
   

3. Further Information
   -------------------

   Just look to doc/manual in the sourcedir or in the specified 'docdir'
   (default: /usr/share/doc/packages) after installation.

   Muttprint has manpages, too. Run "man muttprint" or use another
   manpage browser (e. g. Konqueror: "#muttprint") to read it. For
   printing the manpage, use "man -Tps muttprint | lpr".

   If anything doesn't work as expected and if you read all
   documetation, write to me <Bernhard.Walle@gmx.de>.




   Have a lot of fun ...
