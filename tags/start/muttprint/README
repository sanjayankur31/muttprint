MUTTPRINT - ReadMe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------




This file should give you a short overview about what to read:


User's guide (doc/manual/*):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the full manual which contains all important things about
Muttprint. Especially:

- History,
- installation,
- integration in your favourite mail or news client and
- changing the configuration file.



Install notes (INSTALL):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a short guide to install from the source package. If you use RPM or
Debian packages or if you read the User's guide, you need not read this
file. It's English and no translations are available because of this
reason.



Gnus notes (README.Gnus):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Gnus is the mail client you would like to use with Muttprint, this files
contains important information (and a few lines LISP code!).



Translation notes (README.translations):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If English is not your native language, you could read this file. It
contains the state of translation and some notes. If you speak Czech, you
*should* read this file because of important notes. Otherwise, the
information in the User's guide about using another language should be
enough.



Manpage (man muttprint):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to use command line options, this Manpage is important
for you. Otherwise it may contain interesting information. So, if you have
time left, read this manpage. Translations are available, you system's man
program should give the right translation. You could use

        man -L en muttprint
		
to read the manpage in another language than your system's.



Change log (CHANGES):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is interesting if you update from a earlier version of Muttprint
and you would like to see what has changed in the meanwhile.



License information (COPYING):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This contains the full GNU General Public License (GPL). If the
information, that Muttprint _is_ distributed under the terms of GPL, is
enough for you, you needn't read this file. But it's one condition of the
GPL that a full copy must be included with the software.
