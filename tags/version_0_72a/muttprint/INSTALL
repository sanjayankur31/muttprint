1. Installation
   ------------
   
   To install Muttprint on your system, adjust the locations in the
   Makefile. 

   The default settings should be OK. (Installation to /usr/local)

   Run "make" to build the small C program ("muttprint-langinfo"). You
   need this only if your Perl version is less than 5.8.x.  If you have no C
   compiler and you run Linux then you can skip this step, too.

   Now run "make install" to install the files on your system. Please
   recognize that you must run this as 'root' if you would like to
   install Muttprint global on your system.

   If you don't want to change the Makefile, you should run "make
   prefix=/new/path docdir=/path/for/documentation install" as done by
   creation of RPM packages. Set /new/path and /path/for/documentation to 
   your preferred directory.


2. Uninstallation
   --------------

   To uninstall, run "make uninstall" or "make prefix=/new/path
   docdir=/path/for/documentation uninstall" if you had specified any prefix 
   in the installation.


3. Further Information
   -------------------

   Just look to doc/manual in the sourcedir or in the specified 'docdir'
   (default: /usr/share/doc/packages) after installation.

   Muttprint has manpages, too. Run "man muttprint" or use another
   manpage browser (e. g. Konqueror: "#muttprint") to read it. For
   printing the manpage, use "man -Tps muttprint | lpr".

   If anything doesn't work as expected and if you read all
   documetation, write to me <Bernhard.Walle@gmx.de>.




   Have a lot of fun ...
