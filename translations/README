For translators:

If you want to translate Muttprint just take the translation-example.pl file, 
rename it to translation-XX.pl where XX is you language code according to 
ISO 639-1 and translate. Save the file in UTF-8 encoding (that's important). If 
your text editor hasn't this feature built-in, save it in any encoding and use

$ recode iso-8859-1..utf-8 translation-XX.pl

where iso-8859-1 is your native encoding. If you are unsure, you can use
the command "locale charmap" on Linux (or "muttprint-langinfo -c" if you
have installed Muttprint already) to find out the charset of your current
locale environment.

Thanks for tranlating, the users will thank you!
